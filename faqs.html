              We are going to have fun with it! Let's work together to be
              creative and bring your personality to life, whether it be as an
              individual, pair, or group.
            </p>
            <p>
              For individuals - I will make sure you feel as comfortable and
              confident as possible. Want some music? Let's turn it up. Want to
              try several outfits? Let's mix it up. I will make sure to be your
              personal guide and hype woman!
            </p>
            <p>
              For pairs & groups - I'll give some space to connect and explore.
              Of course we will get a couple posed images, but most of our
              session will be organic and laid back. The goal is to capture
              authentic connection. I will make sure to provide guidance
              throughout the session!

              I used to send a style guide to all clients, but I quickly
              realised that this isn't a one size fits all kind of situation.
              Let's talk about your personal style, the location, and vibe of
              the session and we can figure out the perfect outfit for you
              together. I'll make sure to point out all of the does and don'ts
              when choosing colours, fabrics and layers.

              My current turnaround time is two weeks, but sometimes that may be
              shorter or longer. If you need a gallery by a certain time, please
              let me know when booking your session so I can make sure I am able
              to meet your needs.

              Editing is one of my favourite parts of the process, and I think
              it is equally important as capturing the images. I take my time to
              refine each image in order to deliver an uniform, beautiful
              gallery to each client.

              Family sessions include immediate family. Any additional family
              members added to the session will add an additional fee. Please

            <p>
              I have a lifestyle approach to newborn sessions, rather than a
              gallery full of posed and wrapped images. I believe that newborn
              sessions should represent the emotion, bond and imtimacy involving
              welcoming a new baby into your family!
            </p>
            <p>
              If you would like a couple of wrapped and posed shots, please let
              me know before booking your session so I can make sure to fit your
              needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              I think in-home sessions are the best approach for a newborn
              sessions. This way you can feel comfortable in your home while you
              take breaks for feeding, changing, and calming down your little
              one. Babies are unpredictable and need to be treated with
              patients, so please do not feel stressed or rushed during your
              session. I am prepared for as many breaks as we need to make sure
              I deliver a beautiful gallery to remember this special time in
              your life!

              I recently moved from Katy to Bryan/College Station. I will travel
              at no cost to Katy and surrounding areas for previous clients.
              There will be a travel fee for any new clients that want a session
              20 miles outside Bryan/College Station area. The fee depends on
              distance, so please contact me when booking your session.

              Studio sessions can be a great options for clients who want a

            </p>
            <p>
              Studio fees typically range from £75-£200, and will be added to
              the base price of the session.

              I spent many years developing my shooting and editing style, but
              it is always evolving. I factor in the clothing style and colours,
              location, light and overall mood of the session while I edit, so
              some galleriies may vary slightly from each other. Typically I
              have a warm, earthy, moody style, but I encourage you to take a
              look at my gallery and instagram to get a better idea of what to
              expect!
