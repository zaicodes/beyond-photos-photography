## Design

### Colour Scheme:

![colour-palette](https://github.com/zaicodes/beyond-photos-photography/blob/main/documentation/colour-palette.png)

- The colour palette consists of four distinct shades, each with its own unique meaning and representation.

- The pure white (#ffffff) symbolizes cleanliness, and simplicity. It represents a sense of clarity and openness. On the other hand, the intense black (#000000) conveys strength, authority. It adds a touch of sophistication and elegance to the palette.

- The shade of light grey (#F2F2F2) brings in a sense of neutrality, balance, and professionalism. It provides a subtle contrast between the white and black, creating a harmonious blend. This hue adds a touch of modernity and refinement to the overall palette. I used this shade particularly to separate sections.

- The vibrant red (#FF0000) stands out as a bold accent colour, representing passion, energy, and excitement. It adds a dynamic element to the palette, catching the viewer's attention and creating a focal point.

- Together, the colour palette combines the purity and simplicity of white, the strength and mystery of black, the neutrality and professionalism of light grey, and the passion and energy of red. It creates a visually striking and well-balanced palette that blends elements of clarity, sophistication, modernity, and dynamism.

### Logo:

![Logo](https://github.com/zaicodes/beyond-photos-photography/blob/main/documentation/navbarlogo.png)

![Logo](https://github.com/zaicodes/beyond-photos-photography/blob/main/documentation/navbarlogo-removebg-preview.png)

- The logo was created using [FreeLogoDesign](https://www.freelogodesign.org/) and it consists of the name of the website under a heart shape. The heart represents warmth and it aims to attract and gives a welcoming sense to the users.

### Typography:

- Montserrat (sans-serif) was chosen for titles and navbar links.
- San Serif was chosen for paragraph text throughout the site.
- I imported these fonts using Google Fonts.

### Imagery:

- The image on hero section in the home page was chosen to be attractive, sophisticated and in-keeping with the theme of the site.
- The images on the other pages were chosen to be relevant to the content of the page and to showcase the work of the photographer, it follows the style and complements the colour palette of the site.

## Wireframes

During the planning phase, I used Balsamiq to create wireframes for each page and establish the website's structure.

## Features

The website consists of six pages, four of which are readily accessible from the navigation menu: the home page, gallery page, FAQs page, and contact us page. The fifth page becomes accessible once the user clicks the "More Review" button in the testimonial section on the home page. Moreover, there is a confirmation page that appears after a user submits the form on the contact us page.

The website utilizes Bootstrap grid sizes and CSS3 media queries to ensure a responsive layout that automatically adjusts and reflows when the screen is resized.


### Navigation

![navbar](https://github.com/zaicodes/beyond-photos-photography/blob/main/documentation/testing/navbar.png)

The navigation bar consists of the Beyond Photos Photography logo that links to the home page, as well as links to Gallery, FAQs and About/contact us pages. It exhibits responsiveness, adapting to different screen sizes seamlessly. 

![responsiveness](https://github.com/zaicodes/beyond-photos-photography/blob/main/documentation/testing/responsive.png)

On larger screens, the links are presented as clickable page titles. However, on medium and small screens, a hamburger menu is employed to ensure optimal usability.

![active page](https://github.com/zaicodes/beyond-photos-photography/blob/main/documentation/testing/nav-line.png)

- Beneath the navigation bar, there is a black title line which indicates the current page the user is on. This feature enhances navigation and provides clarity throughout the browsing.

### The Landing Page Image
![hero-section](https://github.com/zaicodes/beyond-photos-photography/blob/main/documentation/testing/hero-section.png)

- The landing page includes a photograph with text overlay to let the user understand the purpose of the website.
- Underneath of the headline, there is a Call-to-Action (CTA) button which can lead to contact us page.

### Gallery
![gallery](https://github.com/zaicodes/beyond-photos-photography/blob/main/documentation/testing/gallery-section.png)

The gallery can be accessed from the home page via the gallery section, allowing visitors to learn more about the photographer's work and style. 

![gallery](https://github.com/zaicodes/beyond-photos-photography/blob/main/documentation/testing/gallery.png)

The gallery page boasts an array of photos showcasing the photographer's unique and captivating work. Each photo is adorned with a hover effect, adding a touch of uniqueness and creating an interesting and pleasing visual experience for the user.

### Testimonials
![testimonials](https://github.com/zaicodes/beyond-photos-photography/blob/main/documentation/testing/testimonial.png)

The Testimonials section showcases customer reviews, providing valuable insights for new users who are exploring the website for the first time. 

![testimonials](https://github.com/zaicodes/beyond-photos-photography/blob/main/documentation/testing/testimonial-small-screen.png)

This responsive section optimizes the display based on the screen size: all three testimonials appear on the same line on large screens, and individually on three lines for medium and smaller screens. This ensures that users have a seamless and user-friendly experience, regardless of the device they are using to access the site.

### Services
![services](https://github.com/zaicodes/beyond-photos-photography/blob/main/documentation/testing/services.png)

The service section, titled "Our Packages," is prominently displayed on the home page. Here, you will find a list of three enticing offers along with their respective prices. Beneath the packages, a clear and compelling call-to-action button awaits, guiding users to easily book a session when they feel ready. Whether you are a first-time visitor or a returning customer, this seamless process ensures that you can quickly select and book the perfect package to suit your preferences and needs.

### Footer
![footer](https://github.com/zaicodes/beyond-photos-photography/blob/main/documentation/testing/footer.png)

The footer will be present across every page of the site, featuring the logo and social media icons that link directly to the corresponding social media websites. This will enable users to effortlessly stay up to date with the photographer's latest updates and events on various platforms.

### FAQs Page

![FAQs](https://github.com/zaicodes/beyond-photos-photography/blob/main/documentation/testing/faqs.png)

The FAQs page serves as a valuable resource for users seeking answers to their inquiries before finalising a session booking. Moreover, it features a convenient call-to-action button, urging visitors to get in touch with the photographer directly in case their specific question is not addressed in the existing list of FAQs.


### About/Contact Us Page

![about-me](https://github.com/zaicodes/beyond-photos-photography/blob/main/documentation/testing/about-me.png)

The "Contact Us" page showcases an "About Me" section, presenting a concise introduction of the photographer, accompanied by a photo of her.

![form](https://github.com/zaicodes/beyond-photos-photography/blob/main/documentation/testing/form1.png)

![form](https://github.com/zaicodes/beyond-photos-photography/blob/main/documentation/testing/form2.png)

Additionally, the page serves as a platform for users to book their desired photography session through a booking form. This form offers various session options, allowing users to select the one that best suits their needs.

![location](https://github.com/zaicodes/beyond-photos-photography/blob/main/documentation/testing/location-details.png)
For the user's ease, the "Contact Us" page provides multiple contact methods, including email, phone, and address details. Furthermore, it includes a map displaying the photographer's location for easy navigation and interaction.

### Review page

![reviews](https://github.com/zaicodes/beyond-photos-photography/blob/main/documentation/testing/reviews.png)

To access the review page, the user must click on the "More Reviews" button found in the testimonial section on the home page, where they can find a collection of additional reviews. This feature allows users to make more informed and positive decisions after reading a broader range of reviews.

### Confirmation page

![confirmation](https://github.com/zaicodes/beyond-photos-photography/blob/main/documentation/testing/confirmation.png)

After successfully submitting a form, a confirmation page briefly appears, displaying a "Thank You" message. This page also informs the user that they will be redirected back to the home page shortly. The purpose of this confirmation page is to acknowledge the submission and assure the user that their action was successful before taking them back to the main home page.

### Features Left to Implement

Given more time, I would have implemented additional features to enhance the website's functionality. One of these features would be a dedicated blog page, allowing the photographer to share her latest blog posts with clients and visitors.

Additionally, I'd have integrated a search bar at the top of the website's navigation bar. This search feature would enable users to easily search for specific keywords and find relevant content on the website. These improvements would have made the website more user-friendly and informative.

## Accessibility

Throughout the coding process, I have prioritized making the website as accessible-friendly as possible. To achieve this goal, I have implemented the following strategies:

- Utilizing semantic HTML elements such as header, section, nav, and footer to provide a clear and meaningful structure to the website, enhancing its accessibility.

- Including descriptive Alt attributes for images and links, which enables screen readers to convey the purpose and context of the content to visually impaired users.

- Incorporating a hover effect on all buttons to ensure that users can easily identify when they are interacting with a button, enhancing the user experience.

- Ensuring a sufficient colour contrast across the site to improve readability for users with visual impairments (check TESTING.md for colour contrast testing)

- Making the navigation menu accessible by marking the current page as current for screen readers, allowing users to easily understand their current location within the website.
