## Project Goals

### Initial discussion:

Beyond Photos Photography, a photography business that captures the special moments. I'm looking to create a website that showcases gallery, contain information about service/prices, and provides a platform for potential clients to contact us and book a session.
The website should also assist visitors in making informed decisions by offering a gallery, testimonials and price list, and an FAQ page.

- Photographerâ€™s work (gallery page)
- The FAQs that the user may have (FAQs page)
- How to book a session, send a question and learn more about the photographer (About/Contact page)
- An an additional feedback page that appears after submitting the contact form, allowing users to provide their input
- Additionally, a dedicated 404 page is included to handle any errors or broken links..

### Target Audience

The intended audience are those who are looking for professional photography services and want to book a session, including:

- Individuals and families
- engaged/married couples.
- maternity and newborn clients

## User Experience (UX)

### Client Goals

First time visitors goals are:

- Gathering Information: Visitors want to learn about the photographer's services, such as session types, pricing, locations, and overall experience, to see if they align with their needs.
- Evaluating Quality and Style: They aim to assess the photographer's work by exploring the gallery and examples of previous sessions to see if the artistic style matches their preferences.
- To easily navigate around the content of the site.
- Building Trust and Credibility: First-time visitors seek indications of the photographer's professionalism, experience, and reputation through testimonials and client reviews.
- Contacting or Booking a Session: Many visitors want to take the next step by finding clear contact information or an easy-to-use booking system to inquire about location, availability and secure a date for their desired session.

Returning visitors goals are:

- Checking for Updates or Promotions: They are interested in any new session options, special offers, or upcoming events introduced since their last visit.

- Seeking Contact Information or Support: They may have questions, need support, or want to enquire about rescheduling a session, seeking advice on photo products, or addressing any other concerns.

Frequent visitors goals are:

- Monitoring for Special Events or Limited Offers: Frequent visitors want to stay informed about exclusive sessions, special events, or limited-time offers that the photographer announces, anticipating unique opportunities.

- Researching for Future Sessions or Projects: They use the website as a research tool, exploring session options, gathering ideas for themes or locations, and seeking inspiration for their own photography projects.

## Design

### Colour Scheme:

![colour-palette](https://github.com/zaicodes/beyond-photos-photography/blob/main/documentation/colour-palette.png)

- The colour palette consists of four distinct shades, each with its own unique meaning and representation.

- The pure white (#ffffff) symbolizes cleanliness, and simplicity. It represents a sense of clarity and openness. On the other hand, the intense black (#000000) conveys strength, authority. It adds a touch of sophistication and elegance to the palette.

- The shade of light grey (#F2F2F2) brings in a sense of neutrality, balance, and professionalism. It provides a subtle contrast between the white and black, creating a harmonious blend. This hue adds a touch of modernity and refinement to the overall palette.

- The vibrant red (#FF0000) stands out as a bold accent colour, representing passion, energy, and excitement. It adds a dynamic element to the palette, catching the viewer's attention and creating a focal point. This intense hue conveys a sense of urgency and evokes strong emotions.

- Together, the colour palette combines the purity and simplicity of white, the strength and mystery of black, the neutrality and professionalism of light grey, and the passion and energy of red. It creates a visually striking and well-balanced palette that blends elements of clarity, sophistication, modernity, and dynamism.

### Logo:

![Logo](https://github.com/zaicodes/beyond-photos-photography/blob/main/documentation/navbarlogo-removebg-preview.png)

- The logo was created using [FreeLogoDesign](https://www.freelogodesign.org/) and it consists of the name of the website under a heart shape. The heart represents warmth and it aims to attract and gives a welcoming sense to the users.

### Typography:

- Montserrat (sans-serif) was chosen for titles and navbar links.
- Inter (sans-serif) was chosen for all other text throughout the site.
- I imported these fonts using Google Fonts.

### Imagery:

- The image on hero section in the home page was chosen to be attractive, welcoming and in-keeping with the theme of the site.
- The images on the other pages were chosen to be relevant to the content of the page and to showcase the work of the photographer, it follows the style and complements the colour palette of the site.

## Wireframes

During the planning phase, I used Balsamiq to create wireframes for each page and establish the website's structure.
